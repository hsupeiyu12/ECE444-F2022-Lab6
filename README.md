## Pros and Cons of TDD

### Pros

- Write code just needed: Following the principles, you just need to write the simplest code to make sure the feature is working. 
- Easy to maintain: the modular design ensures that each component of the application will not couple with each other. Hence, it is easier to maintain.
- High test coverage: one function one test which gives a high test coverage of your code.


### Cons

- Internal bugs: Can not find internal bugs that you introduce within the test code and in implementation code
- Slow down the process: for each single function, we have to write more code to test it which will take more time. Also, if the requirements or code structure changed, all the test cases need to be rewritten.
